      <h1>Trello is the free, flexible, and visual way to organize anything with anyone.</h1>
      <p>
            Drop the lengthy email threads, out-of-date spreadsheets,
            no-longer-so-sticky notes, and clunky software for managing
            your projects. Trello lets you see everything about your
            project in a single glance.

      <p>
            This is a Trello board. It’s a list of lists filled with cards, used
            with a team or by yourself.
      </p>
      <img src="" width="1222px" height="663.641px" />
      <p>
            Drag and drop cards between lists to show progress.
            Add as many people as you need and drag them to cards.
            Add and reorder lists as you need. <strong>Trello
            adapts to your project, team, and workflow.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
            You’ll see everything about your project just by glancing at the
            board, and it all updates in real-time. There’s nothing to set up
            and everyone gets it instantly.

    <section title="Usos de Trello">
      <p>
            Trello is simple on the surface, but cards have <strong>everything
            you need to get stuff done</strong>. Post comments for instant
            feedback. Upload files from your computer, Google Drive, Dropbox,
            Box, and OneDrive. Add checklists, labels, due dates, and more.
            Notifications make sure you always know when important stuff
            happens.

            Trello will never overwhelm you with features you won’t use.
            For those who want more out of their boards, there are
            <strong>Power-Ups</strong> like calendar, card aging, and voting,
            that you can turn on. It’s a way to offer more without
            cluttering things for everyone.
